STORY: The Consequence of Cowardice

A farmer wanders cautiously through the forest fearful of the hostile surroundings.
But desperate times called for desperate measures, and so he was foraging for food for his family.

+ve and -ve are varied valencies on how our character feels about this topic - their WorldView .
Chance is the probability of an outcome or consequence

Farmer:
-ve Feelings on Danger = Displeased
-ve Feelings on Loss(Family) = Very Displeased
Displeased @ Chance of Danger = Fear # Being a weak farmer, he has a greater fear of danger/death/pain than a warrior (worldView)
Displeased @ Chance of Death(Family) = Bigger Fear # The survival of his family is more important than his own safety

As the farmer forages he happens upon a free spirited warrior in a clearing. 
The warrior seems unconcerned about his dangerous surroundings, and infact seems quite pleased with himself.

Warrior:
-ve Feeling of Danger = Displeased # Our warrior still considers danger a stressful situation, but far less so than the farmer
+ve Feeling of Battle = Pleased # On the other hand, Our Warrior loves the thrill of battle. He believes the greatest things in life are to to crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women.
Displeased Feeling @ Chance of Danger = Fear
Pleased Feeling @ Chance of Battle = Hope

Our warrior is excitable and hopeful for a chance encounter to test his skills and triumph.
Before either can act, the sudden silence is broken by a crashing of brush and a hellish roar. 
The Dread Seeker enters the clearing.

Dread Seeker:
-ve Feeling on Danger = Displeased # Even the dread seeker doesn't like danger
+ve Feeling on Food = Pleased # But he is very hungry, so for the moment at least. His view on food is very positive
-ve Feeling @ Chance of Danger = Fear # The dread seeker is unconquored, and though he fears danger, he feels the chance of danger is low. These farmer types are easy prey.
+ve Feeling @ Chance of Food = Hope # Fooooood!
He's hungry, the feelings about food are heightened and override fear.

The warrior jumps to his feet and grabs his longsword. 
Calling out to the farmer he yells triumphantly. "Come, let us slay this foul beast"

Warrior:
+ve Feeling about Conquest = Pleased
+ve Feeling about Battle = Joy (Actual Consequence)
-ve Feeling about Pain = Displeased # Though not as severe as the farmers.
-ve Feeling about Death = Displeased # Though not as severe as the farmers.
Joy from Chance of Battle Confirmed = Satisfaction
Pleased Feeling about Chance of Conquest = Hope
Displeased Feeling about Pain = Fear
Displeased Feeling about Death = Fear

Our warrior values conquest very highly and his fear of pain and death are dampened by his worldView
The farmer on the other hand is terrified.

+ve Feeling about Consequence = Pleased (barely, our Farmer likes the idea of conquest, but not THAT much.)
-ve Feeling about Danger = Distress (Actual Consequence)
Distress from Chance of Danger Confirmed = Fears-Confirmed
Displeased Feeling about Chance of Death = Fear
Displeased Feeling about Chance of Pain = Fear
Pleased Feeling about Chance of Conquest = Hope

The Farmer looks between the Warrior, and the gnarling gnashing teeth of the dread seeker. "Not on your life sir, I'm fleeing.""
The Farmer abandons the Warrior to his battle, and flees into the forest.

Farmer:
-ve Feeling of Abandon = Displeased # Cowardice is a bad thing. But when you're weak, it doesn't seem that bad considering.
+ve Feeling of Escape = Pleased # Survival is a strong motivator.
Disapproval of Self Action(Abandon) = Shame
Displeased about Chance of Death = Fear
Displeased about Chance of Pain = Fear
Pleased about Chance of Escape = Hope
He feels ashamed that he's leaving the warrior to his doom. 
But his hope of escape overrides any feeling of shame. At least for now.

The Warrior snorts in disgust at the farmers cowardice.
-ve Feeling of Action(Abandon) = Dissapprove # Cowardice is weakness, and abandoning allys or combat are seen very negative
Dissapprove of Others(Farmer) Action(Abandon) = Reproach
Displeased about Chance of Death = Fear
Displeased about Chance of Pain = Fear
Pleased about Chance of Conquest = Hope
The warrior turns to his foe and says, "come, lets dance"

.. etc. etc. This continues on. As the warrior fights his fear of death will increase as it's chance increases, 
likewise if he's winning, then his chance of conquest continues to rise too.
So if they are evenly matched, it could easily go down to the wire.
